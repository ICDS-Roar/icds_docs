title: System Access
---

The Roar systems are available for all users with Penn State access. Non-Penn State members who are collaborating with Penn State researchers are able to get a Penn State SLIM access account and then sign up for a Roar account.

  

#### 4.1 Sponsorship

Each non-faculty member signing up for an account must have a sponsor. This is typically the adviser or course instructor. The request requires the Penn State username and not an alias. The [Penn State directory](http://www.work.psu.edu/ldap/) can be used to figure out the username if only another email alias is known.  

  

#### 4.2 Permissions to use Resources

The users who have access to an allocation are placed in an allocation group. Users can see all of the groups they are in by using the `id` command.

To gain access to an allocation or a group storage, have the PI send an email to the i-ASK Center ([iask@ics.psu.edu](mailto:iask@ics.psu.edu)) stating the user IDs (ex. abc123) and the allocation(s) and group storage(s) you wish to add them to. This explicit permission must be granted before users are allowed access.  

  

#### 4.3 Getting an Account

Users with a Penn State ID can sign up for an account using: [<span class="cmtt-10">https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu</span>](https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu)  

Faculty member accounts require no sponsorship. Students and staff require a faculty sponsor, which must be listed by their original Penn State ID, rather than by an alias. The sponsor will get an email stating they were listed as a sponsor. The faculty member can respond to the iAsk center ([<span class="cmtt-10">iAsk@ics.psu.edu</span>](mailto:iAsk@ics.psu.edu)) with either explicit approval or a denial. If no denial is given, the student or staff member will be granted implicit approval after two business days. Faculty members can send an email with multiple users if they will be sponsoring multiple accounts, such as for a class project. After an account has been approved, it can take up to twenty-four hours before the system updates and the user is able to login.  

Users who do not have Penn State ID but are collaborators from other institutions need to acquire a Penn State SLIM account before they sign up for a Roar account and Duo. To request SLIM account, please follow these [instructions](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/).  

You will need to wait for your SLIM access account to be created before you can proceed to request your Roar account or sign up for two-factor authentication.
